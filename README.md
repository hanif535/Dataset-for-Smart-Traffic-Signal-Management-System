About Dataset
Introduction:
Traffic congestion remains a significant challenge in urban environments, and optimizing traffic signals plays a crucial role in easing traffic flow. This dataset is designed to aid researchers and developers working on intelligent traffic management systems. It provides comprehensive data collected from three different sources, each offering unique insights into vehicle detection and traffic patterns.
Dataset's collection strategy:
Kaggle Data Collection
1. Source: Curated datasets from Kaggle, including well-known vehicle detection collections.
2. Content: Contains images and labels of vehicles such as cars, buses, and bikes.
3. Purpose: Provides standardized data for baseline testing and model comparisons.
4. Format: Images in JPEG format with associated YOLO compatible label files (.txt).
